        <h2>About Me: Angela Wang</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Angela Wang. I am a 4th year student at Northeastern University graduating in May 2025,
        and I am majoring in Business Finance and Accounting with a minor in Data Science. 
        I grew up in the Bay Area in California for my entire life, but I have been in Boston for the past 4 years for college.
        In spring of 2024, I chose to do my co-op back in the Bay Area, because that's where I want to work full-time after I graduate.
        In fall of 2024, I studied abroad in Hong Kong, which was one of the best experiences of my life, as I met new people from all over the world.
        On campus, I am part of Alpha Kappa Psi as the Vice President, as well as formerly being part of CASE Consulting Club as a Senior Consultant. 
        My co-ops were at Bain Capital and Ernst & Young, add 
        my internship this past summer was at PwC, which is where I plan to return to full time.
        Outside of school, I enjoy dance, workout classes, drinking coffee, trying new restaurants, and watching football.
        However, my biggest hobby is travelling and exploring the world, which is what my website is going to be about.
