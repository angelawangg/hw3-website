        <h2>More About Travel</h2>
        <p>As I said earlier, I love to travel, which is what my website is going to be about.
            Last year in 2024, I travelled to 22 different countries and 60 different cities,
            with some of my favorites being Japan, Philippines, Vietnam, Hungary, and Spain.
            Each country I travelled to left an amazing impression on me, such as the waters of the Philippines, the food of Japan,
            or the history in Spain. The more I travel, the more I realize how diverse the world truly is.
            So far in 2025, I have been to Hawaii, California, and Costa Rica, and I plan on visiting more countries in Europe, Asia, and South America.
            Some travel destinations at the top of my bucket list are Iceland, Croatia, Dubai, Brazil, and Australia.
            One of my regrets is not learning to appreciate travel earlier. Before 2023, I travelled here and there, especially with family,
            but I don't feel like I fully appreciated the places that I travelled to, nor did I really feel a purpose to explore the world.
            I have travelled a good amount with family, but I remember when I was younger, I would dread activities that we did or complain that I was bored or tired.
            However, now when I travel, I realize that it's a privilege to be able to travel around the world,
            and it's something that I hope to be able to do for the rest of my life.
